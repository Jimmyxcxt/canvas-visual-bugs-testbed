This repository contains the test \<canvas\> game, collected data, and experiment analysis from the paper:
  
`Automatically Detecting Visual Bugs in HTML5 <canvas> Games`
  
Submitted to ASE 2022.

- The code for our testbed (i.e., the version of the game with injectable bugs) can be found in `testbed/`
- The code for the non-buggy version of our test \canvas game can be found in `game/`
- Our collected data, i.e., the screenshot, *\<canvas\> object representation* (COR) pairs, can be found in `data/`
- Our experiment analysis can be `analysis/`.
- Our experiment results can be found in `analysis/results`.

*We will put our code and data in a more final repo (e.g., Zenodo) for the final version of the paper.*

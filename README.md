## Automatically Detecting Visual Bugs in HTML5 \<canvas\> Games

This repository contains the test \<canvas\> game, collected data, and experiment analysis from our paper: `Automatically Detecting Visual Bugs in HTML5 <canvas> Games`, accepted at ASE 2022.

### The test \<canvas\> game
- The code for our testbed (i.e., the version of the game with injectable bugs) can be found in `./testbed/`
- The injectable visual bugs can be found in `./testbed/bugs/`
- The code for the non-buggy version of our test <canvas> game can be found in `./game/`

  
### Our collected data
- Our collected data, i.e., the screenshot, \<canvas\> object representation (COR) pairs, can be found in `./analysis/data.tar.gz` 
- Our collected data is also available on Zenodo at the following link: https://zenodo.org/record/6950640
  
  
### Experiments and analysis
- Our experiment analysis can be `./analysis/`
 
- Our experiment results can be found in `./analysis/results/`
  
- Our implementation of our approach is available in `./analysis/sprite_similarity/`

## Caber Catch

This is the non-buggy version of our test \<canvas\> game.

### To run the game, run a local HTTP fileserver at this directory.

For example, with Python,

`python3 -m http.server --directory "./<path_to_this_folder>/" 8000`

would start a fileserver at this folder, which could be accessed on your machine or local network at `localhost:8000`
